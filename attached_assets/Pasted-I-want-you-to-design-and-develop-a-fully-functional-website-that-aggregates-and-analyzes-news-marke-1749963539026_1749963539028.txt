I want you to design and develop a fully functional website that aggregates and analyzes news, market sentiment, and technical data for stocks and cryptocurrencies from across the internet, including content in different languages, which will be translated into the user’s selected language. The website should provide actionable insights to help users make informed investment decisions, including sentiment analysis, technical indicators, and user-defined filters like price limits. Below are the detailed requirements and features for the website, including a rewritten version of the provided stock/crypto analysis prompt for seamless integration.
Website Features and Requirements
News Aggregation and Translation:
Aggregate news articles, blog posts, and social media posts (e.g., from X, Reddit, and other platforms) related to stocks and cryptocurrencies from across the internet, regardless of the source language.

Use natural language processing (NLP) to translate all content into the user’s chosen language (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.) with high accuracy.

Summarize and categorize news as "positive," "negative," or "neutral" using sentiment analysis.

Display a percentage breakdown (out of 100%) of positive vs. negative news for each stock or cryptocurrency queried.

Market Sentiment Analysis:
Analyze overall market sentiment (bullish, bearish, or consolidating) for the broader stock and cryptocurrency markets.

Provide a sentiment score (0–100%) for individual stocks or cryptocurrencies based on:
Social media sentiment (e.g., X posts, Reddit discussions).

Community engagement (e.g., mentions, likes, or follower growth).

News sentiment (positive vs. negative articles).

Highlight macroeconomic factors or upcoming events (e.g., regulatory changes, earnings reports, or blockchain upgrades) that could impact sentiment.

Search Functionality:
Include a prominent search button and an input bar where users can type the name or ticker symbol of a stock or cryptocurrency.

Upon input, the website gathers and displays:
Recent news and sentiment analysis.

Fundamental data (e.g., company overview for stocks, project utility for cryptocurrencies).

Technical analysis (price trends, volume spikes).

On-chain metrics for cryptocurrencies (e.g., active addresses, exchange supply) or on-stock metrics (e.g., institutional ownership, short interest).

Price Limit Filter:
Allow users to input a price limit per share or coin (e.g., “I want to spend no more than $50 per share”).

The AI filters and analyzes stocks or cryptocurrencies within this price range, prioritizing those with strong positive sentiment, technical indicators, or news.

Display results with a clear explanation of why the filtered assets are promising within the user’s budget.

Chart Analysis via Screenshot Upload:
Include a section where users can upload a screenshot of a stock or cryptocurrency chart (e.g., from TradingView).

The AI analyzes the chart, specifically focusing on:
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Identify overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Detect bullish (MACD line crossing above signal line) or bearish (below signal line) crossovers.

Volume: Highlight significant volume spikes or trends indicating strong buying/selling pressure.

Provide a prediction of potential future price movements (e.g., uptrend continuation, reversal) based on these indicators, with a clear disclaimer that predictions are not guaranteed.

Deep Search Mode:
Implement a “Deep Search” mode (activated via a button) where the AI iteratively searches the web and social media for real-time data, cross-references it, and provides a detailed analysis.

This mode should enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis, news aggregation, and technical/fundamental insights.

Report Generation:
Allow users to generate downloadable reports summarizing the analysis for their queried stock or cryptocurrency, including:
Sentiment scores (news and social media).

Technical and fundamental highlights.

Opportunities and risks.

Chart analysis results (if a screenshot was uploaded).

Ensure reports are clear, concise, and formatted for easy reading (e.g., PDF or HTML).

User Interface (UI):
Design a clean, intuitive interface with:
A search bar and button at the top.

A dropdown menu for selecting the user’s preferred language.

A section for uploading chart screenshots with clear instructions.

A filter input for price limits.

Visualizations (e.g., pie charts for sentiment breakdown, line graphs for price trends).

A “Deep Search” button for advanced analysis.

Ensure the website is mobile-friendly and accessible across platforms (e.g., web, iOS, Android).

Disclaimers:
Prominently display a disclaimer that all analyses are informational and not financial advice.

Include a note that users should conduct their own research and consult financial advisors.

Integrated Stock/Cryptocurrency Analysis Prompt
The website should include an AI-driven analysis engine that follows this rewritten prompt to identify and analyze promising stocks or cryptocurrencies based on user queries:
Prompt for Stock/Cryptocurrency Analysis Engine:
I need a comprehensive analysis of the current stock and cryptocurrency markets to identify trends and pinpoint one to three specific stocks or cryptocurrencies showing strong positive news, sentiment, and analytical indicators. The goal is to provide users with clear, data-backed insights into why these assets are promising, while highlighting potential risks. Follow these steps:
Overall Market Sentiment & Trends:
Summarize the prevailing sentiment in the stock and cryptocurrency markets (e.g., bullish, bearish, consolidating).

Highlight macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, inflation) or industry events (e.g., earnings seasons, blockchain upgrades) that could influence the market.

Criteria for Identifying Promising Assets:
Based on data from the past 7–30 days, identify stocks or cryptocurrencies with:
Consistently positive news coverage (e.g., partnerships, product launches, regulatory approvals).

Strong community engagement (e.g., high social media activity on X or Reddit).

Favorable fundamental, technical, or on-chain/on-stock metrics.

Prioritize assets with clear reasons for positive sentiment (e.g., new exchange listings, earnings beats, or protocol upgrades).

Deep Dive into Identified Assets (1–3 Candidates):
For each selected stock or cryptocurrency, provide a detailed breakdown:
Latest News & Narrative: Summarize recent positive developments (e.g., a company’s new product launch, a cryptocurrency’s mainnet upgrade) and explain why they are significant.

Fundamental Analysis: Outline the asset’s core value proposition (e.g., a company’s market position, a crypto project’s utility). Highlight recent improvements (e.g., revenue growth, increased TVL, or user adoption).

Technical Analysis: Describe recent price action (e.g., breaking resistance, forming an uptrend) and key indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, volume spikes) if data is available.

On-Chain/On-Stock Analysis: For cryptocurrencies, note metrics like active addresses, exchange supply, or whale activity. For stocks, include metrics like institutional buying or short interest trends.

Sentiment Analysis: Provide a sentiment score (0–100%) based on social media (e.g., X posts) and news sentiment. Reference specific platforms or indices if applicable.

Opportunities & Risks:
Outline why the asset is a potential opportunity (e.g., strong momentum, growing adoption).

Highlight risks (e.g., market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, competition).

Output Format:
Start with a market summary, followed by individual analyses for each asset.

Use concise, clear language, avoiding jargon unless explained.

Include visualizations (e.g., sentiment pie charts, price trend graphs).

Clearly state that this is informational and not financial advice.

Sources:
Reference data sources (e.g., “X posts indicate,” “market data suggests”) to enhance credibility.

Additional Notes

Optimize for speed and scalability to handle large volumes of data and user queries.

If generating images (e.g., for visualizations), confirm with the user first.

For chart analysis, explicitly support TradingView screenshots with RSI, MACD, and volume indicators, as specified.
